## Github Marketing

You can help out the project by just â˜… starring this repository from the upper right corner and also by pinning it to your profile.

## Getting Started

It's very easy to set-up a local server in order to test and contribute to the development version of this game project.<br>
It uses web languages like HTML, CSS, Javascript and Node.js. The game engine used is free open source, named [Phaser](http://phaser.io).

### Recommended Tool

If you're not very keen on using git from the CLI, I highly recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), for cloning the project and creating patches. [VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is free open source and cross platform, has very nice git integration and useful extensions.

### Fork Project

You can create a clone of the project by using git from CLI or with the use of a tool, like the one recommended above.

```
https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast.git
```

In [VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) you can press `Ctrl + Shift + P` hotkey, search for `Git: Clone` and then input the link in the given field.

### Package Requirements

First install (or make sure you have) the latest LTS version of [Node.js](http://nodejs.org).

Linux users: if you installed from repository, you _might_ need to create a path link.

After you've successfully installed the Node.js package, proceed with installing the latest version of [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install), which is our tool of choice for package dependency management.

### Installing Dependencies

In the terminal (`Ctrl + ~` in [VCS](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)), use the following command in order to easily install all the project dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

This will read `package.json` and install all of the gameplay established yarn package dependencies.<br>
The `yarn install` command will also update any required dependencies if `package.json` file changes. If you have not worked on the project in a while, make sure you update your fork and also run that command again, which will also compile the project, same as the `yarn build:dev` command.<br>

If you're using Windows OS and getting errors, have your desired tool `Run as administrator` or to disable your anti-virus.

### Compile Project

In order to build the development version of the game (also done by `yarn install`), run the following command:

```
yarn build:dev
```

### Betatest Game

To have the game up and running, simply run this command in the terminal, it will copy the link to the clipboard:

```
yarn start
```

You should open the game link using <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/"><b>Google Chrome</b></a> or <a href="https://www.chromium.org"><b>Chromium</b></a>, as other browsers don't usually quite cut it.

You can always test the latest master without any hassle from https://ancientbeast-beta.herokuapp.com deploy.

A handy tip while testing: you can right click the game tab and mute it by simply clicking the `Mute site` option.

## Getting Involved

After you've playtested the development version of the game, there are 2 main ways you can contribute to the project.<br>
For a more comprehensive guide on how to help out the project, you can check out the [Make Your Contribution](https://AncientBeast.com/contribute) guide.

### Report Issues

If you encounter any problems with this version, you can report them to our [GitHub Issue tracker](https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast/issues).<br>
Very often, it will be very helpful for debugging purposes to fetch game logs when encountering issues.<br>
You can use this function from the browser console window in order to fetch the log `G.gamelog.get()`.<br>
To replay a match, you can start a new game and paste the log between brackets of `G.gamelog.play()`.<br>
In order to open up Google Chrome browser's console, you can simply press `Ctrl + Shift + J` hotkeys.

### Patch Game

The main coding language used is Javascript, feel free to create patches and propose them by making a Pull Request.
You should look around on GitHub Issue tracker for open issues, priority being the ones that are assigned to the next [milestone](https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast/milestones) and are tagged "[Priority](https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast/labels/Priority)", while also lacking the "[Brainstorm](https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast/labels/Brainstorm)" tag. You can ping [DreadKnight](https://github.com/DreadKnight) in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/x78rKen) in order to be assigned to something specific, otherwise you can comment on a specific issue in order to receive the green light for it, making sure there's nobody else currently working on the issue or that design hasn't changed and a patch is still required. The game engine we're using is the [community edition](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-ce) of [Phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser), which is free open source and has nice [documentation](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce).

In order to patch the game and constantly test it, run it using this command, which will keep track of any file changes:

```
yarn start:dev
```

Keep in mind that you'll have to refresh the webpage after making changes. Make sure to disable browser caching by using `Ctrl + Shift + J`, then going to the **Network** tab and checking **Disable cache**.

### Next Step

You are free to browse [existing issues](https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast/issues) and comment on the ones that you want to take a swing at in order to make sure the issue is still relevant and that nobody else is working on it. You can also drop by the project's [Discord server](https://discord.gg/x78rKen) and mention your skills and that you're interested in helping out; you'll be assigned to a specific issue. When you're done, simply create a **Pull Request**, note that you might need to pull in from master repository before doing so. Your patches will get reviewed and tested, if there are issues with them you'll receive feedback in order to make corrections, otherwise your pull request will get approved and merged into the master branch and you'll getting you credited for your work.
